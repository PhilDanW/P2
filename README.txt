# P2

Author: Philip Wright
Project: The Parser
Class: CMPSCI 4280-002
Completion Date: April 12, 2021

Got my Scanner to function properly for the Parser.
For my scanner project it would compile but gave a segmentation fault when ran.
This is the part where I ask for some missed points on my P1 project!

Program Instructions:
To make executable type:
        make
To clean the directory type:
        make clean
To run the executable there are 2 ways:
        1. ./parser
        -this option allows for the user to input code instead of giving a file
        2. ./parser [filename]
        -this option allows the user to specify a file
        -files in this case end with the extension ".sp21"
 
 Project was able to run and complete parsing on all good tests given to us.
 The parser is printing the tree in the correct order but am having trouble getting the tokens to indent
